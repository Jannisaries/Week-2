Second week was figuring out the physics, score, and death for the game. 
We tried to make it so when the object touches the player then the object reacts / despawns. 
Next, we developed pick-ups in the game that used that methodology. These were the coins.
They and the bullets that can kill the player were building upon that physics base.
